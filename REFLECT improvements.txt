#### improvements
Add instruction for each configuration
Shake window/phone if > 75% of timer and no buttons pressed
Add groups to the button layout (e.g. under students have buttons related to listening, talking, working)
- make instructor elements match student (e.g. asking and answering questions vs lecturing and listening)
Add %'s to engagement buttons in `COPUS (test)`
Make a prompt if an interval was missed and give a chance to add for the last interval
Add pause button?
Add 'time left in interval' button
Maybe flash screen or make some visual cue that time has reset
Show the protocol chosen on the observation page
Canceling stop and save should go to paused obs page, which can be restarted (it currently sends home)
Change low to max 30%
Make listening to listening/watching to include observing demonstartion

1. A Response Timeline 
  - It can be kept as it currently is
2. Three pie charts
  - one each for engagement, instructor actions, and student actions.
3. An engagement moving average plot
  - encode engagement to 1 (low), 2 (medium) or 3 (high)
  - blanks should be ignored
